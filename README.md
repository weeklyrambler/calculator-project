# calculator-project

This is a project from the Odin Project's Foundation's Course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is the final project in that course to bring all knowledge learned so far together into one project. 

The aim of this project is to create a visual calculator application that can perform basic calculations by interacting with buttons on the screen and being able to see the output within the calculator.
